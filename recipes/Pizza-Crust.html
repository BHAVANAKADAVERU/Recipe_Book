    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>2 cups bread flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><strong>Procedure</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a small bowl. Let stand until creamy, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine bread flour, olive oil, sugar, salt, and yeast mixture in a mixing bowl; stir well to combine. Beat until a stiff dough has formed. Cover the bowl; let rise at room temperature until dough doubles in volume, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

        </li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a well-floured surface. Form dough into a round and roll out into a thin crust. Cover with your favorite sauce and toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake pizza in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbly and crust is golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
